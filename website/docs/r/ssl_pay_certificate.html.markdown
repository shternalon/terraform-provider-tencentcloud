# tencentcloud_ssl_pay_certificate

~> **NOTE:** Provides the creation of a paid certificate, including the submission of certificate information and order functions;
currently, it does not support re-issuing certificates, revoking certificates, and deleting certificates; the certificate remarks
and belonging items can be updated. The Destroy operation will only cancel the certificate order, and will not delete the
